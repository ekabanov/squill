It uses the database metadata and generics to catch as many errors as possible during compilation and is almost completely typesafe. At the same time it is designed to allow everything SQL allows you to do, exactly the way SQL is meant to do it. This means that you're encouraged to select only the data you need and no hidden queries are generated for you, leaving you in full control of the query performance. Squill also supports database-specific extensions, allowing you to both use advanced features and fully tweak your queries.\r\n\r\n## Documentation:\r\n\r\n* Quick Start Guide\r\n* Step-by-Step Example Tutorial\r\n* Devoxx Presentation\r\n* Metadata generator documentation\r\n* DSL documentation","google":"","name":"Squill","tagline":""}
